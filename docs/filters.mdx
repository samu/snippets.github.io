# Filters

Filters look very similar to snippet containers. They offer the same display
modes and allow you to define fields.

The key difference is how they reference snippets. Snippet containers explicitly
reference specific snippets, while filters do not. Instead, filters implicitly
reference snippets by selecting them based on matching criteria.
