# Introduction

Note-taking is a meaningful process. It helps us hold on to thoughts, shape
ideas, and make sense of what matters to us. Some notes are fleeting — we need
them only for a moment before letting them go. Others stay with us for years,
perhaps for a lifetime.

We take notes every day. In the morning, to prepare for what lies ahead. At
work, to find our way through complexity. In our personal lives, to track goals,
habits, and ideas. When studying, to turn what we’ve learned into something that
stays with us.

Note-taking is therefore a fundamental part of our lives — so essential that it
deserves a tool designed to support it well.

That is where Snippets comes in.

Snippets is a note-taking app built with deep care and attention to detail. It
was designed from the ground up to be flexible, lightweight, and powerful. It
adapts to different people and different ways of thinking. More than just a
place to write things down, it is meant to become a long-term companion - a
productivity space that supports you throughout your life.

## A great rich text editing experience

### Why editing quality matters

Good rich-text editing is easy to underestimate, but it matters a lot. Writing
is the thing you do most in a note-taking app, and when the editor feels awkward
or unpredictable, everything else becomes harder.

### Where editors often fall short

Many rich-text editors struggle with the basics. Creating or removing formatting
can feel clumsy, it’s often unclear whether the cursor is inside or outside a
formatting, pasting content produces odd results, and clicking a link may open a
browser instead of letting you edit it. These, among others, are small issues on
their own, but they quickly add friction to everyday writing.

### Markdown and block-based apps don’t solve this

Markdown-based editors avoid some of this, but often feel jumpy and hacky when
editing. Block-based apps take another approach, but by splitting everything
into separate blocks they introduce hard boundaries that get in the way of
simple text editing.

### Closing the gap

Snippets tries to take the good parts from all of this and leave the rest
behind. Writing is rich-text-first and continuous, but you can still use
familiar keyboard shortcuts to create and remove formatting. You can move
cleanly in and out of formatted text, rearrange content when needed, and fall
back to a toolbar for more explicit actions.

The result is an editor that feels predictable and unobtrusive, and lets you
focus on writing instead of managing the editor.

### Purposely not Markdown-Based

Snippets is intentionally not based on Markdown. Markdown works well for
technical documentation and collaborative workflows where content lives in
version control. For note-taking, it quickly becomes a constraint.

By moving beyond Markdown, Snippets can rely on rich, structured data instead of
plain text files. This enables far more expressive content and supports a wide
range of use cases without forcing everything into a text-only format. Concerns
about vendor lock-in are addressed through a simple export-to-Markdown option.

## 5 Core concepts

Snippets is made up of 5 core concepts. They exist in isolation and accumulate
to great power once combined.

### The 'Snippet'

Everything you create in the app is a _Snippet_.

- Rich-text notes are snippets
- Folders are snippets
- Dashboards, flashcards, and flashcard decks are snippets

The app is based on a flexible architecture: anything that can be described as a
JSON document and represented with a UI can exist in the app. This makes
Snippets adaptable to many workflows, including personal knowledge
management,writing and journaling, task and habit tracking and studying and
learning systems.

### References

Snippets can reference other snippets.

- Notes can reference other notes
- Folders and dashboards can reference notes
- Flashcard decks can reference flashcards

This allows multiple organizational styles:

- hierarchical, like traditional folders
- network-based, using wiki-style links
- visual, using dashboards

You are free to mix and match these.

### Attributes

Attributes are structured pieces of information attached to snippets. They are
best thought of as a hybrid between classic tags and structured properties.
Attributes have a defined data type (e.g. string, number, date), can be assigned
an icon and a color and can be used inline in rich text or as table fields.

### Filters

Filters implicitly reference snippets based on queries. Instead of manually
organizing content, filters automatically collect snippets that match certain
criteria.

### Origins

Origins define where your data lives and how it is synced. Your data can be
divided into workspaces, and every workspace is synced to an origin you define.

## A productivity app that does it all

Most productivity apps follow the same pattern: focus on a narrow niche, solve
one specific problem, and keep everything tightly scoped. From a marketing and
development standpoint, this makes perfect sense — it keeps the product simple
and easy to position.

But for users, it often creates a frustrating reality.

Essential features never materialize because the app’s architecture was never
designed to support them. Workflows become fragmented across multiple tools.
Data gets scattered. And in the end, people find themselves paying several
subscriptions just to cover relatively simple, everyday needs.

Snippets takes a different approach.

Instead of solving one small problem, it is designed from the ground up to
support a wide range of productivity use cases within a single, coherent system.
Its flexible architecture allows it to grow with the user, rather than forcing
users to adapt to rigid limitations.

## Made to fit your workflow

Today, Snippets already supports a wide range of productivity use cases:

### Simple note-taking

Keep things lightweight. Whether it’s a few notes, quick thoughts, or simple
to-do lists, you’ll feel right at home. Add structure with folders, dashboards,
and snippet references whenever needed — or keep everything beautifully simple.

### Rich text editing

Write beautifully structured documents. The editor is powerful when you need it,
and invisible when you don’t.

### Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

Organize your knowledge however you like: with folders, dashboards, references,
and flexible tagging. Stay on top of the ideas and insights you collect every
day.

### Task management

Powerful and deeply integrated, right out of the box — designed to handle
everything from simple to-dos to complex workflows.

### Cataloguing & structured data

Build rich tables with customizable columns and multiple data types — perfect
for collections, inventories, research, and more.

### Journaling, habits, and goals

Reflect on your life, track progress, build streaks, and stay aligned with what
truly matters to you.

### Flashcards & studying

A focused environment for learning, memorization, and structured study.

### There is more to come

There are many more features planned: PDF support, calendar integration,
whiteboards, voice memos and audio transcription, Web Clipping, AI integration,
grocery lists, and much more. Follow us to stay tuned.

## Privacy guaranteed

### Flexible sync

Snippets gives you full control over how and where your data is stored. Keep
everything offline by syncing to a local folder, use a GitHub repository for an
open and independent setup, or choose our dedicated cloud service.

### End-to-end encryption

Your data is encrypted before it leaves your device. End-to-end encryption is
built in to our cloud service.

### Workspaces

Organize your information into separate, isolated workspaces — keeping projects,
contexts, and data neatly partitioned.
