# Rich-Text Editor

The rich-text editor in Snippets is the heart of the app.

Because of its central role, it was designed with great care and usability in
mind. It works equally well for users who prefer to navigate and edit entirely
by keyboard, as for those who enjoy a more visual editing experience using the
mouse and familiar interface controls.

## Markdown-like syntax

If you're comfortable with Markdown, you'll feel right at home. Snippets
supports the syntax you already know:

- Type `#` + <kbd>Space</kbd> to create a heading
- Type `**text**` + <kbd>Space</kbd> to create bold text
- Type `>` + <kbd>Space</kbd> to create a block quote
- Type `*` + <kbd>Space</kbd> to create a bullet list
- etc.

## Creating and removing formatting

Formatting is easy to apply and just as easy to remove:

- Use <kbd>Space</kbd> to create formatting
- Use <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to remove formatting

The following video shows how backspace is used to destroy the formattings,
followed by using space to bring them back:

## Navigating formatting boundaries

You can move in and out of formatting using the arrow keys on your keyboard. In
the video below, the cursor reaches the edge of the bold text by pressing
_ArrowRight_, allowing you to continue typing in bold. Pressing _ArrowRight_
once more moves the cursor out of the bold formatting, so you can continue
writing in the surrounding style. The same behavior applies when entering the
green formatting.

## Drag & drop

Text nodes can be selected by double-clicking at their end. Once selected, they
can be dragged to a different position within the document.

## Built-in toolbar

For more advanced interactions, the editor includes a toolbar that exposes
richer formatting and structured elements.
