# Flashcards

Flashcards are a first-class feature in Snippets, designed for studying, repetition, and long-term retention.

## Flashcard decks

Flashcard decks are both a learning tool **and** a way of organization.

- Decks can be created from the **navigation bar**
- Like folders and dashboards, decks organize content
- A deck contains related flashcards

## Flashcards

Flashcards live inside decks.

Each flashcard represents a single learning unit, making it easy to build structured study material over time.

## Learning sessions

From a deck, you can start a **learning session**.

- Flashcards are presented one by one
- Progress is tracked automatically
- Progress is visualized in a chart

This makes learning visible, measurable, and motivating.
