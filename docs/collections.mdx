# Collections

Collections reference snippets and provide display modes that let you visualize
the data in different ways.

They also allow you to define fields. For example, you can choose to display a
snippet's title and description — each of which is treated as a separate field.

## Display Modes

### Table

Displays the contents in a table view. Each field appears as a column. You can
sort by columns, search within the table, and select multiple items at once

### List

Displays the contents as a list. Each entry appears as a separate card, showing
the selected fields. Lists are especially useful for task management scenarios.

### Grid

Displays the contents in a grid layout. It uses the same card concept as the
list view, but arranges the cards in multiple columns.

### Timeline

Displays the contents as a chronological timeline. This makes it easy to use a
container as a journal or activity log.

A time range picker lets you focus on specific periods, such as daily, weekly,
monthly, yearly, or all entries.
