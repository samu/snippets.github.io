# Ways of Organization

Snippets does not force you into a single organizational model. Instead, it
offers multiple approaches that can be used independently or combined.

## Folders

<Row>
  <div style={{flex: 1, paddingRight: "1rem"}}>  
    Folders provide a hierarchical way of grouping related snippets. While
    hierarchical organization is sometimes criticized for being too rigid, folders
    continue to be highly effective for broad, stable structure. They can be
    nested, and icons can be added to make sections easier to recognize at a
    glance.
  </div>

</Row>

## Dashboards

Dashboards offer a more visual way of working. They provide a two-dimensional
workspace where multiple elements can exist side by side, making it easy to keep
related information together. Rather than relying on hierarchy, dashboards
support spatial organization: content is arranged visually, and relationships
emerge from layout and proximity. This makes dashboards especially well suited
for overviews, projects, and workflows where seeing multiple pieces of
information at once is valuable.

## Snippet references

Snippets can be linked together through references. References allow you to
connect related pieces of information without placing them into a fixed
hierarchy. This makes it possible to navigate quickly between ideas, follow
chains of thought, and build a network-like structure where meaning emerges from
connections rather than location.

## Attributes

Attributes can be used for tagging. Tagging is helpful when you want to organize
things in a more flexible way: instead of placing content into a specific
location, you simply assign attributes to it. You can then, for example, filter
by those attributes later.

## Collections

<Row>
  <div style={{flex: 1, paddingRight: "1rem"}}>  
  Collections reference other snippets and offer a variety of display modes. 
  They can be placed on dashboards, and you can choose which fields or columns 
  to display.

</Row>

## Filters

While folders, dashboards and containers explicitly reference specific items,
filters turn the relationship around: they implicitly reference items based on
matching criteria. Snippets supports a wide range of filtering capabilities.
