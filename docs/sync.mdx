# Sync

Snippets is offline-first by design. It has a built-in abstraction layer which
allows it to sync to different targets. You can use the app fully offline and
without creating an account: All your data is stored locally on your device and
always remains under your control. You decide how your data is synced or backed
up: if you want, you can sync with a GitHub repository or our own cloud service.

## Sync Targets

### Local folder

All data is stored in a folder of your choice on your local disk. This allows
you to back up your notes using tools like Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, or
external disks and keep full control over your files without relying on any
external service.

The limititation with folder sync is, that it is not possible to sync your data
to a mobile device, and there is no good way to share notes with other users.

### GitHub Repo

Snippets can sync your data to a GitHub repository. There is no need for manual
or scheduled commits. Instead, Changes are synced automatically as soon as a
document is modified. GitHub HTTP API is used under the hood, making it suitable
for desktop and mobile devices.

### Snippets Cloud _(coming soon)_

Snippets Cloud is the official hosted sync solution. It gives you the following
options:

- seamless multi-device sync
- E2E encryption (optional)
- note sharing and collaboration _(planned)_
- note history _(planned)_

You can use our cloud service for free with certain limits. Upgrade to a Pro
plan for unlimited use.

## Workspaces

Snippets allows to separate data into workspaces. Every workspace has its own
target. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how to organize your work. For
example, you can choose to store a temporary throw-away project on your disk
with folder sync, create an unencrypted cloud workspace to share some notes with
friends, create an E2E-encrypted workspace for your journaling, and a
GitHub-synced workspace for work.

## Local Cache

Every change you make to your documents is saved immediately in a local cache.
This means you can continue using the app without restrictions even when you’re
offline. As soon as you’re back online, everything syncs automatically.
